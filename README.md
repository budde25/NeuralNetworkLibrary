# NeuralNetworkLibrary
A custom Java library for building simple neural networks

## Usage
NeuralNetwork() takes up to four inputs,
int input nodes is the amount of inputs for the neural network,
int hidden nodes is the amount of hidden nodes for the neural network,
int output nodes is the amount of outputs for the neural network,
double learning rate the seed at which the network learns (optional, default 0.1)

feedforward() gets the outputs for given inputs,
train() trains the network with the inputs and target outputs
